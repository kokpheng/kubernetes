## Introduction

You can give your deployments easy to remember names like WordPress‚ÄìMySQL for the MySQL database for your WordPress instance. Or give it secret object for the database password the MySQL‚Äìpass name, this all makes sense if your Kubernetes cluster only being used by single user, team or project. But what would happen if you had multiple teams each running their own WordPress instances on your cluster? They'd have to fight for who claim the name `wordpress-mysql` first. And those that came afterward would have to append some sort of unique modifier. This would create a mess not just in name uniqueness but in manageability for you in the system administrators. This is why Kubernetes introduces namespaces.

## What are namespace? Why use them?

- Namespaces create multiple virtual clusters on the same physical clusters, these virtual clusters are called namespaces
- Namespaces provide separation, when you start to need them, start using them
- Until then, using ‚Äúdefault‚Äù is just fine

Namespaces provide a scope and separation for names. Names of resources have to be unique within a namespace but not across namespaces. Namespace is a way to divide cluster resources amongst multiple users or teams. You can use resource quotas to assign how many resources each namespace can use. It is not necessary to using multiple namespace to just to separate slightly different resources. Such as different versions of the same software. Use namespace for different logical organizations, projects and the like.

For example a namespace for software development, hardware development and human resources might make sense in a company dedicated to hardware and software development.

## Resource Limits in namespace

When several users or teams share cluster with a fixed number of nodes or resources, there maybe a concern that one team or one namespace could use more than its fair share of resources adversely affecting other users on the system.

Resource quotas are a tool that you can use to address this concern. A resource quota, which is defined by creating a resource quota object, provides constraints that limit resource consumption per namespace. It can limit the quantity of objects that can be created in namespace by type. As well as the total amount of compute resources that maybe consumed by resources in that project. Resource quota is enforced on a particular namespace when there is a resource quota object created for that namespace. It‚Äôs not required but if you‚Äôre going to set a resource quota, there should only be one resource quota per namespace.

- Namespaces can be assigned ResourceQuota objects
- Each namespace should have at most one (but it is not required)
- This will limit the amount of usage allowed by the objects in that namespace
- You can limit:
  - Compute
  - Storage
  - Memory
  - How many objects can exist

![](Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas.assets/Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas-ec167b61.png)

This resource quota is defined in a file that you can apply using the `kubectl create` or the `kubectl apply` command against a given namespace. This provides a resource quota that only allows `4 pods`. Request for `CPU` can we `request 1 CPU` at a time, request for `memory` cannot exceed `1 GB` and the total usage of `CPU` within the namespace cannot exceed `2 CPU` and the total usage of `memory` in the namespace cannot exceed `2 GB`.

Further information about the variety of limits, the types of limits that you can set etc. is available in the Kubernetes documentation. Namespaces provide the basis for a large variety of controls, which are coming in future versions of Kubernetes. For example on the roadmap for Kubernetes development is providing access control to objects based on namespaces. That way members of the HR team may not be able to access items in other development organizations and vice versa. Remember namespaces aren‚Äôt required. Working in the default namespace may be suitable for your needs for quite sometime. However they provide you a mechanism to think about how you can scale and grow access to your Kubernetes cluster and maintain control and reliability.

## Useful Commands for namespaces

Let‚Äôs look at some useful commands for namespaces. By now you should be able to guess what these commands might look like. Namespaces follow this same pattern for many other type of Kubernetes objects. When you create a service or deployment or even a persistent volume, you use a set of commands `create`, `get` and `describe`. These are the same.

- To create a namespace you can do the `kubectl create` namespace command.
```
kubectl create namespace <namespace name>
```

- You can list namespaces using the `kubectl get` namespace command.
```
kubectl get namespace
```

For more information on more detailed commands to use with namespaces are available in Kubernetes documentation.

## Practical Example

- Let‚Äôs examine a deployment that requests a certain amount of CPU (200m per container with 3 replicas, for a total of 600m of CPU) in a namespace that only has 400m of CPU allocated using resource limits. **Note:** You‚Äôll note that we are expressing CPU usage in a unit of `m`. 200m for example corresponds to 20% of an average defined Kubernetes CPU.
- Let‚Äôs examine how Kubernetes handles this
- Our Steps Will Include
  1. Create a namespace
  2. Assign the namespace a 400m CPU resource limit
  3. Deploy Tomcat (as we have in the past) into this new namespace but this time with 3 replicas requesting 200m CPU each
  4. Use kubectl to examine deployment status

### 1. Create namespace

We'll use the `kubectl create` namespace command and will provide the name `cpu-limited-tomcat`.
```
kubectl create namespace cpu-limited-tomcat
```
![](Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas.assets/Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas-c98a76f3.png)

[(Back to top)](#-table-of-contents)

### 2. Assign Limit

Next we'll assign a resource quota to this namespace. In this case we'll use the `kubectl create -f` command to create the CPU limits defined in [cpu-limits.yaml](source-codes/Advanced%20Kubernetes%20Usage/Namespaces%20and%20Resource%20Limits/cpu-limits.yaml) file as shown here. A hard limit on CPU of 400M, which is 40% of a CPU.

![](Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas.assets/Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas-31d38c99.png)

- Create ResourceQuota
```
kubectl create -f ./cpu-limits.yaml --namespace=cpu-limited-tomcat
```
![](Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas.assets/Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas-ccc69a75.png)

Remember the new thing in this command will be the --namespace parameter. In the past we‚Äôve only create things the default namespace specifying `--namespace` equals the name of the namespace. We'll run that command against the specified namespace this is nomenclature used across nearly every kubectl command.

You‚Äôll notice that the resource quota was appropriately created. We can use the `kubectl get resourcequota` command again applying the `--namespace=cpu-limited-tomcat` to see if that was applied with the name compute-resources.
```
kubectl get resourcequota --namespace=cpu-limited-tomcat
```

### 3. Deploy Tomcat with Resource Request & Replica
Next we'll deploy Tomcat with into the same namespace.

We'll also make a few changes to the Tomcat deployment from earlier in this tutorial. Let's look at them in turn:
- First we specify `3 replicas`
- In the `containers` specification we made sure to `request 20m` of a `CPU` for each container. Remember this applies to each container in the pod and not overall for the pod.

![](Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas.assets/Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas-273bf4a3.png)

So in this case given three replicas there go three containers each will be requesting 200 M or 20% of the CPU. Doing the math as we discussed earlier this will create a requirement for `600m` or `60%` of a CPU for this deployment to be fully provisioned.

Remember we just in the last step had created a resource limitation on the namespace of 400 M CPU or 40%. Think about how the failure might occur and what it look like.

We'll use the `kubectl apply` command that we've used before with the addition of the namespace flag that we've just discussed.
```
kubectl apply -f ./tomcat-deployment.yaml ‚Äînamespace=cpu-limited-tomcat
```
![](Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas.assets/Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas-fa89d2d3.png)

[(Back to top)](#-table-of-contents)

### 4. See Deployment Status

Finally once we‚Äôve done the aforementioned steps we'll use the `kubectl describe deployment` command to see what the status deployment is.
```
kubectl describe deployment tomcat-deployment --namespace=cpu-limited-tomcat
```

Remember we are applying the `--namespace=cpu-limited-tomcat` command flag to our execution to ensure that we‚Äôre looking at the Tomcat deployment in the proper namespace. If we'd left that off we'd be looking at the Tomcat deployment in the default namespace. This is important to understand because you could have the same name across in multiple namespaces and you looking at something entirely different. Remember we‚Äôre operating in the `--namespace=cpu-limited-tomcat` namespace and we have to specify that to Kubectl.

![](Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas.assets/Advanced - Namespaces & Resource Quotas-dc6793b3.png)

In this case you can see if the deployment has failed.
- First the new replica set was created and that worked.
- The next check if the minimum number replicas available failed.
- Looking down a little bit more in the event section, you can see that it‚Äôs tried to scale the replicas set to three but it didn‚Äôt create successfully.

An important failure aspect to notice is that the reason it failed was minimum replicas unavailable. Instead of creating two out of three replicas, Kubernetes failed it and all or nothing fashion. This is important to note, we specified three minimum replicas in our deployment and since Kubernetes was not able to fulfill that due to a quota that we imposed it‚Äôs simply didn‚Äôt create anything. Had this been a situation where we had a horizontal pod auto scaler with a minimum one replica and a maximum of five Kubernetes would‚Äôve created as many as it could up to the maximum because we had specified a minimum below what was available.

This is an important aspect to note when troubleshooting Kubernetes deployments. Looking at the conditions area in the events area of the deployment can help provide you clues in troubleshooting as to what might be going on. Minimum replicas unavailable is an error code, which typically points to the replicas being unavailable for some reason.

One of these reasons is unavailable resources to allocate. Further information about these error codes is available in the Kubernetes documentation.

This is only one example of how namespaces and resource limits can be put together to create a system that respects and enforces proper scaling and proper services availability.  If you were to allow a system or a process unlimited way into the system, it could create what‚Äôs called the noisy neighbor problem. One process hogging all the resources on system bringing other things to a grinding halt. This is a complex area of service management well beyond the practice of Kubernetes and it‚Äôs a generic practice in the DevOps and service delivery areas of computing. We've only looked at a few methods as how you can enforce rules in Kubernetes. Consult the documentations for more advanced tools and think about how you can apply resource limits when you're architecting an application.
