## Introduction

Most systems in modern computing require some sort of credentials to secure access to their services, access other services securely, and connect to external systems. Typically these credentials are designed predicated on the fact and the assumption, that some sort of data can and will be kept secret amongst those entitled to know. Common examples of this include a user and password combination, a private key certificate or an API key. Whatever they are there magic lies in the fact that they‚Äôre kept secret amongst those who are entitled to know them. If you know them or have them you can get access to the service. As software systems grow and more developers work collaboratively on them, more system administrators from both inside and outside the organization may work on the system and source code for the application is shared perhaps even publicly on the Internet. The need to secure these secrets through separation from those with the need to know and those without a need to know continues to grow. Soon setting passwords and configuration files on small post notes next to the server or other ad hoc methods just isn‚Äôt enough for both security or convenience.

In many situations legal or other certification compliance needs a built-in method for separating the secret items from nonsensitive information. Kubernetes secrets provide this functionality to hold sensitive information such as passwords, tokens and SSH keys separately from plain text, nonsensitive configuration items. Putting this information in a secret is safer and more flexible than putting it verbatim in a pod definition. You may recall we how we use a single secret to set and share the password for our MySQL database when we were setting up WordPress. This was not only convenient, we only had set the password once in one place for two different services, but it also removed the password from the plain text configuration files. We could‚Äôve shared those files with any number of users, contractors or even publish them on the open source web and our secrets would‚Äôve remained safe.

## Secrets

A secret is an object that contains a small amount of sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. Such information might otherwise be put in a pod specification or an image putting it in a secret object allows for more control over how it is used and reduce the risks of accidental exposure. Users can create secrets and the system also create some secrets.

To use a secret a pod needs to reference the secret once it's created. A secret can be used within a pod within two ways.

- A file placed on a volume at runtime containing the secret data (useful for certificates)
- An environment variable referenced by the Pod and inserted at runtime into the environment by the kubelet running the Pod - just like any other environment variable

#### How Secrets are stored

Secrets are stored in a couple of ways.

- Kubernetes provides separation for secrets but it does not provide strong encryption.
- Secrets are typically Base64 encoded strings. stored separately configuration and injected at runtime.

You can encode the string manually or you can use Kubernetes tools to do it for you. Remember secrets don‚Äôt provide strong encryption. Secrets assume that you've already taken appropriate access control methods to your cloud provider and simply provide separation of the data.

#### How Secrets are structured

Secrets are key value pairs, both the key and the value are arbitrary strings

when you define a secret you‚Äôre not just defining one string you‚Äôre actually defining a set of key value pairs. This data structures is called a map in some vernacular or hash table in others. Basically consider it a set of key value pairs that you can set and retrieve.

#### A Note on Base64

Base64 encoding is a method that stores binary data in a "safe" string by translating it using a "radix-64" representation
- Helps store small pieces of text or non-text data that would otherwise be difficult to handle in systems or data structures that expect text
- Small files, images, or even text can be Base64 encoded - the resulting string is typically "safe" in the sense it does not contain characters many popular systems/protocols such as HTTP or the like do not allow as parameters

The string `"Kubernetes"` is encoded in Base64 as ``"S3ViZXJuZXRlcw=="``

## Creating A Secret

There are two methods you can use to create a secret for further use in other areas of deployments.
- From a file (creates a secret named generic db-user-pass with the username from the username.txt file and password from the password.txt file)
```
kubectl create secret generic db-user-pass --from-file=./username.txt --from-file=./password.txt
```

- From the a literal on the command line (Remember, secrets are set of key value pairs that‚Äôs why the literal here says `password=YOUR_PASSWORD`)
```
kubectl create secret generic mysql-pass --from-literal=password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

## Using A Secret - As an environment variable

Once you've created a secret, the second half is using the secret. You can use a secret as an environment variable.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-63301a10.png)

If you look at this configuration it might look similar. This is the deployment or a snippet of the top of the deployment file for `wordpress-mysql` container.

If you notice at the bottom we‚Äôre defining an environment variable on the `mysql` container. The `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable will be set when the container has started or restarted.

You‚Äôll note that the value comes from a `secretKeyRef`, the name being `mysql-pass` which if you notice in the previous tutorial we created using the command line pulling the key password. Remember reset password equal to our password value. This will pull the key password for the `mysql-pass` secret and inject it into the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable for use by the container. The developers of that container image expect that environment variable will be set and this is how we can hand it off to them in a secure separated fashion. We could also place that secret on the file system as a file.

## Using A Secret - As an file

This is further down in the same configuration file. I've truncated the top so it will all fits on the image. But if you look the spec should be familiar. You can see we‚Äôve added a volume mount under `/etc/secretStore`. We‚Äôve named `secret‚Äìstorage`. This‚Äôll create a mount point on our container at /etc/secretStore.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-20ea248c.png)

Then below in our volume stanza, we‚Äôve indicated what that `volume` is to be. Instead of calling a persistent volume claim and looking for a disk.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-e756cd9e.png)

Kubernetes will attach a file from the secret `mysql-pass`. It will mount that file at `/etc/secretStore` and any process on the system or in the container, we‚Äôll be able to access the file using normal file open and viewing methodologies.

These are two methods of achieving largely the same thing. Of taking a secret and getting it into a running container. Whether it is set as environment variable or as a file. You can choose which one works best for you in your given circumstance.

## Practical Example

- Let‚Äôs remedy a weak-point in our WordPress & MySQL stack: a hard- coded plain-text password. When we were first creating it the DNS lecture, we noticed that the hardcoded plaintext password may not have been the best idea for production great systems.

- Let‚Äôs replace the plain-text value in the deployment with a ‚Äúsecret‚Äù in both the MySQL deployment & the WordPress deployment

##### MySQL Deployment yaml

- We‚Äôll replace the existing environment variable in plain text with an environment
variable to reference a secret

Let‚Äôs have a look at the correct part of the [`mysql-deployment.yaml`](source-codes/Advanced%20Kubernetes%20Usage/Secrets/mysql-deployment.yaml) file that we used to set up MySQL. This should look familiar.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-732c9c44.png)

Remember we‚Äôre a refining an environment variable name `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`. This is expected by the MySQL container because that‚Äôs the way maintainers of that image have defined its defined documentation and works better to provide, in this case we‚Äôre providing the text value directly under declaring that variable. how you define variables in Kubernetes.

If you look at the right-hand part of the screen. The new `mysql-deployment.yaml` has a very slight change. You‚Äôll notice it says the same name `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` as we don‚Äôt want to change the name of the environment variable. But we‚Äôve changed from value to value from and we have provided a `secretKeyRef` which is a secret key reference. Referencing the name of the secret and the key inside the secret where that password can be found. his reference is the secret, which we will then have to go create where the actual password is stored.

##### WordPress Deployment yaml

We'll make the exact same changes to the [`wordpress-deployment.yaml`](source-codes/Advanced%20Kubernetes%20Usage/Secrets/wordpress-deployment.yaml) file.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-2eb31f66.png)

We will change the plain text password value declaration to a value from the exact same secret and the exact same key. You‚Äôll notice in this case we‚Äôre referencing the same secret name and the same key, this way the password is maintained more securely but also in a central location. An unlimited number of deployments and containers can reference one secret making changing passwords across multiple system very easily in this case MySQL protects the database with the given password and anyone accessing it needs to know it.

So providing it in one place allows MySQL, the person who‚Äôs enforcing the password and WordPress the instance that is using the password or that credential to access it through other service to simply reference one object. This makes administration easy so one come time to change the password multiple configuration files don‚Äôt have to have the same value. As long as they're referencing the same secret and that secret is updated.

[(Back to top)](#-table-of-contents)

### practice

1. We‚Äôll create the secret using kubectl command line
2. We‚Äôll apply the modified deployments for both MySQL and WordPress that have the new environment variable declaration referring to our secret for the value instead of including it inline across all containers.

##### Migrate deployment

We can now migrate our existing deployment of MySQL and WordPress with hardcoded passwords to secret relatively easily. You‚Äôve already seen the updated files which we‚Äôll apply to our existing instances. The only other remaining step is to ensure that we create the secret before we apply the modifications. We have already shown how to use `kubectl create secrets` from two different sources.

In this case since we only have to set one password we'll elect to use kubectl's command line interface to create a password as an environment variable.

That‚Äôll be step number one then we will apply both the new MySQL and the new WordPress deployments with the change referencing that password instead of the hardcoded variable.

Now that we have all the pieces in place, let's actually go and do it.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-0ac97312.png)

We'll use the
```
kubectl create secret generic mysql-pass --from-literal=password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

This will set the secret in Kubernetes. We can use the Kubectl get secret command to see the secret. It was created; it won't give us the value because it‚Äôs opaque.

```
kubectl get secret
```
![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-4303fc2b.png)

That‚Äôs good, now let‚Äôs apply the MySQL deployment.

```
kubectl apply -f ./mysql-deployment.yaml
```
![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-5a8d871b.png)

The changes have been applied. Let‚Äôs do the same for WordPress using the kubectl apply command for WordPress.

```
kubectl apply -f ./wordpress-deployment.yaml
```
![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-71500102.png)

The changes to WordPress have been also applied. It‚Äôs also verify that the changes were made on the deployments. We will use the `kubectl describe deployment` command to look at the WordPress deployment.

```
kubectl describe deployment wordpress
```
![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-17728d99.png)

Sure enough we can see that the environment variable here is set to the `secret`. Let‚Äôs do the same for MySQL.

```
kubectl describe deployment wordpress-mysql
```
![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets.assets/Advanced%20-%20Secrets-58aa3973.png)

Here we can also verify that the environment variable was set to reference the key password in the given secret. Everything looks good.

Now just as proof that everything is working properly. Let's use the `minikube service wordpress ‚Äìurl` command to get the URL to a WordPress service. Let's copy url to the clipboard, open up a web browser, navigate there to make sure that everything is working properly.
