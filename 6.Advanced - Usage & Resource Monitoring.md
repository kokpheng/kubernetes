## Introduction

Now that weâ€™ve mastered creating usable systems that can persist themselves, letâ€™s start to think about how our application lives in a wild. Itâ€™s not enough to just run an application but we want to be able to run perfomantly, reliably and perhaps even react to changes in usage or various situations. But before we can act on something, we have to know about health of our system. We've discussed health checks in the past, these tell us if something is working or isn't but thatâ€™s relatively binary.

Systems are more than just up or down in the real world. Theyâ€™re busy and slow or fast and have room to grow. Metrics and resource monitoring can help you gain these insights into your system to better inform how you can act or perhaps how even one day an automated system might be able to act on your behalf.

## Many Solutions
Usage and performance monitoring is a large field. Itâ€™s been around since the advent computing.

Thereâ€™re many free and paid packages and services both for Kubernetes and beyond that you can explore, that promise to give you all kinds of insights into your system.

Weâ€™ll explore Kubernetes' native stack with a few open-source additions. This consists of:
- Heapster
- InfluxDB
- Grafana.

Heapster is a CNCF project, which is maintained by the same organization that maintains the Kubernetes. Heapster is installed as a cluster wide-pod. It gathers monitoring and event data for all pods on each node by talking to each Kubelet. The Kubelet itself fetches data from cAdvisor and internal Kubernetes system. Heapster will send this data to InfluxDB and we can visualize it using Grafana.

hese are Kubernetes add-ons that are sometimes enabled by default if youâ€™re running on certain cloud providers like AWS or Google cloud. You really donâ€™t have to do anything more to get this functionality as it is enabled by default.

## Heapster

- Heapster is Kubernetesâ€™ Container Cluster Monitoring solution
- Heapster is maintained by the CNCF

As we mentioned Heapster collects and interprets various signals like compute resource usage, lifecycle events and the like. Heapster supports pluggable storage backends.

We'll use in InfluxDB. Itâ€™s the most common and what comes out of the box in the Heapster add-on. Heapster stores a wide variety data points related to usage and performance from a variety of internal sources namely cAdvisor. By default it collects data from Kubernetes internal processes.

The Heapster documentation can provide more information into how to plug into other sources as well. But the out-of-the-box information to be more than enough for most purposes. This data can then be accessed by user interfaces and other processes to provide visualizations and other actions when pulled from in InfluxDB, where heapster stores it.

## Enabling Heapster on Minikube

- Heapster comes enabled on most cloud-based platforms

Before we actually look at the dashboards, letâ€™s enable Heapster on our Minikube.

On Minikube we will have to enable the add-on first. First we will run the `minikube addons enable heapster` command. This will take a while. Grab a snack!

```
minikube addons enable heapster
```
![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring.assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring-10b256e5.png)

To check the pods status for both Heapster and in InfluxDB pod status:
```
kubectl get pods --namespace=kube-system
```
![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring.assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring-81dae139.png)

If you see container creating and not a full amount pods ready then youâ€™ll know your system is still working. Donâ€™t be worried if this takes up the five or ten minutes.

When the pods are up you can access the Grafana dashboard by typing:
```
minikube addons open heapster
```

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring.assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring-cd63bc1b.png)

If you see this message, itâ€™s pretty self-explanatory. The endpoint for the service is not quite ready yet, keep waiting.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring.assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring-d35622e6.png)

This will open a web browser to the appropriate URL running on Minikube that allows you to log into Grafana and access information about variety of metrics collected by Heapster.

## Grafana

Let's have a look. From the homepage first log in, go to the upper left hand corner, and click sign in. On Minikube the username is `admin` and the password is `admin`.

![](assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring.assets/Advanced%20-%20Usage%20%26%20Resource%20Monitoring-43c7ace7.png)


Once you are logged in, you can navigate to a variety of dashboards. Under the home menu, let's look at our clusters and pod statistics.

- Pods

- Clusters
